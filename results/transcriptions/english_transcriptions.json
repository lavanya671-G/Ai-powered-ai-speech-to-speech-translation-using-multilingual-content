No, I actually got personally as emails telling me how much. Base and our fans were missing me, and one of those emails was from Pulkit and Pulkit too. So like, I did a podcast, I'm missing something without me. But it was great and it's great to be back. I think you read those emails when you were having those Brownies cleaners.

Yeah, that's right. We don't want to hang out. You're getting older. We got a really good look at the 2019 podcast series, like the Indian team should be doing as well. I'm 29.
